# Email OTP Verification System for Registration

## Overview
This implementation adds email OTP verification for customer, vendor, and delivery registration to prevent fake email usage. Users must verify their email address with a 6-digit OTP before their account is created.

## Features

### Backend Changes

#### 1. New API Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/send-registration-otp` - Sends OTP during registration
- `POST /api/auth/verify-registration-otp` - Verifies OTP and creates account

#### 2. Modified Registration Flow
- **Before**: Direct account creation on registration
- **After**: OTP verification required before account creation

#### 3. Data Storage
- Registration data stored temporarily in memory (global.registrationData)
- OTP expires after 10 minutes
- Automatic cleanup of expired registration data

#### 4. Email Verification
- All registered users are automatically marked as email verified
- Uses existing email service infrastructure

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. New Screen
- `RegistrationOTPScreen.js` - OTP verification interface
- Features:
  - 6-digit OTP input with auto-focus
  - 10-minute countdown timer
  - Resend OTP functionality
  - Back navigation to registration

#### 2. Updated Authentication Screens
- **CustomerAuthScreen.js** - Modified to use OTP flow
- **VendorAuthScreen.js** - Modified to use OTP flow  
- **DeliveryAuthScreen.js** - Modified to use OTP flow

#### 3. Navigation Updates
- Added `RegistrationOTP` screen to all navigators
- Seamless flow from registration to OTP verification

## Registration Flow

### Step 1: User Registration
1. User fills registration form
2. System validates input
3. System checks for existing users
4. System generates 6-digit OTP
5. System sends OTP via email
6. User navigated to OTP verification screen

### Step 2: OTP Verification
1. User enters 6-digit OTP
2. System validates OTP
3. System creates user account
4. System generates authentication token
5. User logged in automatically
6. User navigated to main app

## Security Features

### OTP Security
- 6-digit numeric OTP
- 10-minute expiration
- One-time use only
- Rate limiting on resend

### Data Protection
- Registration data stored temporarily
- Automatic cleanup of expired data
- No sensitive data in client storage

### Email Verification
- Prevents fake email registration
- Ensures valid email ownership
- Automatic verification flag

## API Usage

### Send Registration OTP
```javascript
POST /api/auth/send-registration-otp
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phone": "1234567890",
  "password": "password123",
  "role": "customer"
}
```

### Verify Registration OTP
```javascript
POST /api/auth/verify-registration-otp
{
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "otp": "123456"
}
```

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios
- **Invalid OTP**: "Invalid OTP"
- **Expired OTP**: "OTP expired. Please register again"
- **Expired Session**: "Registration session expired. Please register again"
- **Email Already Exists**: "User with this email already exists"

### User Experience
- Clear error messages
- Automatic navigation back to registration
- Resend OTP functionality
- Countdown timer for OTP expiration

## Production Considerations

### Data Storage
- **Current**: In-memory storage (for development)
- **Production**: Use Redis or similar for session storage
- **Benefits**: Persistence, scalability, automatic expiration

### Email Service
- **Current**: Gmail SMTP
- **Production**: Use dedicated email service (SendGrid, AWS SES)
- **Benefits**: Better deliverability, monitoring, analytics

### Rate Limiting
- **Current**: Basic validation
- **Production**: Implement proper rate limiting
- **Benefits**: Prevent abuse, protect resources

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Valid Registration Flow**
   - Register with valid data
   - Receive OTP email
   - Verify OTP successfully
   - Account created and logged in

2. **Invalid OTP**
   - Enter wrong OTP
   - Receive error message
   - Stay on OTP screen

3. **Expired OTP**
   - Wait 10 minutes
   - Try to verify OTP
   - Receive expired message

4. **Resend OTP**
   - Request new OTP
   - Timer resets
   - New OTP sent
